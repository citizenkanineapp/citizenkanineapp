# Plan for Sam's Client Work

1. Write get route to get all current clients from the database
3. Work on POST route for adding a new client
    * Include dog/dogs in the object?  
    * How to not temporarily lose the dog when switching between modal views?
5. Get client schedule (where is this needed?)
    * can it be a different get route route for that view only
6. Edit client form
7. Where will clients add schedule?
8. Need to re-route back to client list after saving client
9. If cancel dog how to get back to add client form with data continuing?
10. Requiring inputs
11. Formatting issues on client details page


# Done
1. Client get route with dogs
2. Displays on table



try using dispatch for each value to update the clientToAddReducer
get value from reducer


openClient has openModal function
dispatch set client then use select for details page
