/*For checking for updates to existing clients and updating them
    most of what happens inside of quickBooksSync AND updateAllQbCustomers should be moved server-side.

    We decided to handle this complicated object management client-side primarily due to path dependancy-- we started working with one large server script (quickbooks.router.js) which contained multiple endpoints.
    As we were building out these functions, we didn't realize the thing to do would have been to break out each endpoint into its own module so that we can send horizontal requests.

    We tried to address this at several times during development, but we had challenges with managing async functions in quickbooks.router.js ;
    for OAUTH, we relied on the Quickbooks node SDK. (server/modules/tools.js ). We have two hypothesis as to what was not working.
    1) the SDK/oauth tool uses 'request' module, not 'axios.' request needs an additional wrapper module in order to handle async. both modules are depreciated, and we did not have time to test async request.
    2) the server-side request functions at each endpoint pass all parameters--headers, req, res--through tool.checkForUnauthorized. this nested function made adapting the entire API call to axios very challenging.
    
    also, if this ever gets moved server-side, middleware in the /api/clients endpoint would need to be adjusted or removed.
